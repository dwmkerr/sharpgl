<p>The native textures sample shows you how you can use the SharpGL.SceneGraph.Assets.Texture object to load texture data, without actually having a Scene.</p>
<p>As with many of the SceneGraph objects, you can use them to make certain tasks more straightfoward (such as loading texture data), but then still use traditional OpenGL calls.</p>
